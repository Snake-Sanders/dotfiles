# LazyVim

Changed to **lazyVim**, see:

<https://www.lazyvim.org/>

## Dependencies

For Git and external tool is needed

`brew install jesseduffield/lazygit/lazygit`

## Changed

* to avoid opening the file explorer sidebar every time lazyvim is launched, do
not use the dot, call it just with: `nvim`.
